      "protected void btnDownload_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\n",
      "{\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Store your download package:** Place your download package (`download.zip` in this example) at the path specified in `$filename`.\n",

      "\n",
      "   `<a href=\"your_script_name.php\">Download Your Package</a>`  (Replace `your_script_name.php` with the actual name of your PHP file).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Alternative: JavaScript redirection:** For a more sophisticated \"Download will begin in a moment\" experience, you can use JavaScript to redirect to the PHP download script after a short delay.  This would allow you to display a message to the user before initiating the download.  Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```javascript\n",
      "   setTimeout(function(){\n",

      "   }, 2000); // 2000 milliseconds = 2 seconds delay\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach ensures browser compatibility and avoids the download being blocked.  The user will see a standard browser download dialog, providing a user experience similar to sites like Download.com. Remember to replace placeholders like `path/to/your/download.zip` and `your_script_name.php` with your actual file paths and script names.  Also, adjust the `Content-Type` header to match the actual MIME type of your download package if it's not a zip file.\n",
